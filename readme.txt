## Performance

### Display

Most terminals aren't designed for massive throughput, so the game cannot be played at full 320x200 resolution at high frames per second.

Pass the command-line argument ```-scaling n``` to determine the level of scaling. Smaller numbers denote a larger display.

A scale of 4 is used by default, and should work flawlessly on all terminals. Most terminals (excluding Windows CMD) should manage with scales up to and including 2.

### Input
The following terminal input options are not mandatory but may improve input handling.
- Disable character repeat delay to prevent delayed repeated inputs.
- Increase polling rate to ensure input on every frame.
